I want this to be a static website that shows my personal projects.
It will use React and react router. Do not use tailwind.
Remove all the unnecessary Vite files and code.
I want my name and a short bio at the top of the page. Under that I want to show 2 cards with links to websites that I've built and tokens showing which technologies they use.
Underneath that I want a horizontal section that shows links to my other github repositories that don't have hosted webpages. In this section I want the cards to be on an infinite horizontal scroll. The user should be able to hover over the section, at which point it will stop scrolling and the user can scroll manually.
It should be responsive and very clean.
